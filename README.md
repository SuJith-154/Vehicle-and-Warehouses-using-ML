python tsp_ga.py
# Write content to README.md file
with open("README.md", "w") as file:
    file.write(content)
print("README.md file created successfully!")

### How It Works:
1. The function `create_readme()` generates a string containing the content for your `README.md` file.
2. It writes this content into a file named `README.md` using Pythonâ€™s file handling.
3. Once the script is executed, the `README.md` file will be created in the current directory with all the necessary details.

You can run this script in the same directory where your project code is located, and it will generate a ready-to-use `README.md` for your project.
